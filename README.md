# What's this about?

What does it take to create minimal copies of the app databases?

What does it take to spin up a minimal "config server"?


# todo

work out out how to fix the error:

```
$ mssql-scripter -S foo
/nix/store/qawhnc2kz1gw94v6fsk1zbwsdyfib960-python3-3.8.5-env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mssqlscripter/mssqltoolsservice/bin/MicrosoftSqlToolsServiceLayer does not exist. Please re-install the mssql-scripter package
```

do we need to extract the tar files during the buildPhase or installPhase?
